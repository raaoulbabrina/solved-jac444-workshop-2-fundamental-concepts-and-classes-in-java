The first assignment lets you practice basic concepts such as encapsulation and abstraction.

A <em>palindrome</em> is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. <em>Stack</em> is a simple data structure/container which acts as LIFO (last element in, would be the first element out.)

In this assignment, first, develop a <strong>Stack</strong> class. Second, develop a second Java class named <strong>Palindrome</strong> that in its <strong>main </strong>method, receives a string as a command-line argument, and then uses a <strong>Stack</strong> object to check whether the given string is a palindrome or not.

Please note the following regarding doing this workshop:

1 – You should implement <strong>your version of </strong><strong>Stack class</strong> (Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_%28abstract_data_type%29">this link</a> if you need) first. <strong>You should not use </strong><strong>Stack class in Java API</strong>. Objects based off our Stack class just know how to <strong>push and pop characters, one at a time</strong>. Your Stack class should be a reusable entity and doesn’t need to know any of the logic that you are going to put in the second class.

2- Based on the specs for this workshop, your solution should be dealing with a sequence of characters and thus, <strong>backed by a </strong><strong>char array (as its storage.)</strong> Please note that since we have not yet talked about ArrayLists, <strong>you should use an array</strong>. In case you like to new/initialize your array based on the size of the command-line argument’s size, you could do it so through a constructor in your Stack class.

<strong>Marking Criteria and Task: </strong>

Please note that you should:

<ul>

 <li>have appropriate indentation.</li>

 <li>have proper file structures and modularization. c- follow Java naming conventions. d- document all the classes properly. e- not have debug/useless code and/or file(s) left in assignment.</li>

</ul>

f- have good intra and/or inter class designs.

in your code!




<ul>

 <li>Task: Developing and running the desired solution: <strong>(you should submit your source code – just individual .java files and screenshots which demonstrate the way your code runs in different scenarios): 5 marks. </strong></li>

</ul>
